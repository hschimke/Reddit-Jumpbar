Reddit Jumpbar is a simple Google Chrome Extension to make sharing and voteing on links easier.

A small Reddit Alien is displayed in the far right of the Omni Bar.
Clicking on the Alien causes the tab to display the "Reddit Toolbar Version" of the current page.
From here the user can submit the link (if it doesn't exist) or vote (if it has already been submitted).

Reddit Jumpbar does not manage any user state.
User credientials are handled by the browser and the user in the usual way.
